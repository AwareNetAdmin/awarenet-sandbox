To the extent allowed by applicable law, rule, or regulation, including any statutes set forth on an Order Form, Confidential Information includes, without limitation, Order Form(s), Customer Data, security reports and attestations, audit reports, customer lists, pricing, concepts, processes, plans, designs and other strategies, "know how", financial, and other business and/or technical information and materials of Disclosing Party and its Affiliates.

Receiving Party is responsible for its Representatives' compliance with Section 7.3. Receiving Party will protect the confidentiality of Confidential Information of Disclosing Party using the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information but in no event less than reasonable care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may disclose our SOC2 or similar report, which will constitute our Confidential Information, only to an End User or an End User's employee or contract worker who has a "need to know" for such SOC2 or similar report and is legally bound to written terms of confidentiality that are at least as protective as the terms of Section 7.3.</p>
                
                <p><strong>7.3.3 Compelled Disclosure.</strong> Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of Disclosing Party if so required pursuant to a regulation, law, subpoena, or court order (collectively, "Compelled Disclosures"); provided, however, that Receiving Party gives Disclosing Party written notice of a Compelled Disclosure (to the extent legally permitted).

                <h2>13. General</h2>
                
                <h3>13.1 No Waiver and Order of Precedence.</h3>
                <p>No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right or enforcing any provision under these Terms will constitute a waiver of that right, provision, or any other provision. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by each party to be legally binding. Titles and headings of sections of these Terms are for convenience only and will not affect the construction of any provision of these Terms. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency among the following documents, the order of precedence will be: (1) the Order Form, (2) these Terms, (3) our Acceptable Use Policy, (4) any other terms incorporated by reference herein, and (5) the applicable Documentation.</p>
                
                <h3>13.2 Assignment.</h3>
                <p>Except for as provided specifically in the Order Form, neither party may subcontract, assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms, any applicable Order Form(s), or performance of its obligations, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other party. Any attempt by a party to subcontract, assign, delegate, or transfer without the required consent shall be null and void. Subject to this Section 13.2, these Terms and any applicable Order Form(s) will be binding on each party and each party's permissible successors and assigns.</p>
                
                <h3>13.3 Relationship.</h3>
                <p>Each party is an independent contractor in the performance of each and every part of these Terms. Nothing in these Terms is intended to create or will be construed as creating an employer-employee relationship or a partnership, agency, joint venture, or franchise. Each party will be solely responsible for all of its respective employees and agents and its respective labor costs and expenses arising in connection with its respective employees and agents. Each party will also be solely responsible for any and all claims, liabilities, damages, or debts of any type that may arise on account of each of its respective activities, or those of its respective employees and agents, in the performance of these Terms. Neither party has the authority to commit the other party in any way and will not attempt to do so or imply that it has the right to do so.</p>
                
                <h3>13.4 Severability.</h3>
                <p>If any provision of these Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable and, in any event, the rest of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.</p>
                
                <h3>13.5 Notices.</h3>
                <p>Notices to us under these Terms will be provided via email to <a href="mailto:legal-notification@awarenet.us">legal-notification@awarenet.us</a>. Notices to you under these Terms will be provided via (a) email to the email address you designate in your account or (b) electronic means via your account portal (e.g., a pop-up window).</p>
                
                <h3>13.6 Force Majeure.</h3>
                <p>No failure, delay, or default in performance of any obligation of a party will constitute an event of default or breach of these Terms to the extent that such failure to perform, delay, or default arises out of a cause, existing or future, that is beyond the control and without negligence of such party, including action or inaction of governmental, civil, or military authority, fire, strike, lockout, or other labor dispute, flood, terrorist act, war, riot, theft, earthquake, or other natural disaster (each a "Force Majeure Event"). The party affected by such Force Majeure Event will: (a) take all reasonable actions to minimize the consequences of such Force Majeure Event; (b) shall be excused from performance to the extent that and for so long as such performance is delayed by such Force Majeure Event; and (c) if applicable, the delivery of the Services affected shall be rescheduled. If, as applicable, the delivery of Services affected are not able to be rescheduled and continued and the Force Majeure Event persists for more than thirty (30) days, then the unaffected party may terminate these Terms.</p>
                
                <h3>13.7 Government Terms.</h3>
                <p>We provide the Services, including any related software and technology, for ultimate federal government end use solely in accordance with these Terms. If you (or any End Users) are an agency, department, or other entity of any government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Services, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data, software, and manuals, is restricted by these Terms. All other use is prohibited and no rights other than those provided in these Terms are conferred. The Services were developed fully at private expense.</p>
                
                <h3>13.8 Dispute Resolution.</h3>
                <p>In the event of a dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or in connection with the Terms, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, or otherwise between the parties (a "Dispute"), mediation shall be a condition precedent to the institution of legal or equitable proceedings. Either party may request mediation in writing by providing notice to the other party describing the nature of the Dispute with sufficient factual detail to allow the other party to understand the nature of the claims (the "Notice"). The parties shall thereafter confer in an attempt to select an agreeable mediator by mutual consent, and in the absence of such mutual consent, the mediator shall be chosen by United States Arbitration and Mediation, Inc. of St. Louis, Missouri. The parties will share equally the fees and expenses of the mediator and endeavor to hold the mediation within ninety (90) days of the date of the Notice. Each party will be responsible for its own incurred expenses arising out of mediation. Any mediation proceedings will take place in the City or County of St. Louis, Missouri, unless otherwise consented to in writing by the parties. Any agreement reached at mediation shall be an enforceable settlement agreement.</p>
                
                <h3>13.9 Governing Law and Venue.</h3>
                
                <p><strong>(a) Venue.</strong> In the event the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute at mediation, either party may commence judicial proceedings in the Missouri State Courts located in St. Louis City, Missouri, which shall be the exclusive venue for any litigation between the parties. To the extent allowed by applicable law, rule, or regulation, in any such proceeding, the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive and the non-prevailing party shall be obligated to pay the prevailing party's reasonable costs and attorneys' fees. <strong>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, RULE, OR REGULATION, THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES A WRITTEN CONSENT TO WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY PURSUANT TO ANY APPLICABLE STATE STATUTES.</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>(b) Governing Law.</strong> The Terms and all other terms, conditions, and agreements between the parties shall be exclusively governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Missouri, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
                
                <h3>13.10 Class Action Waiver.</h3>
                <p>Each party agrees that any Disputes between the parties must be brought against each other on an individual basis only. That means neither party can bring a Dispute as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action. An arbitrator cannot combine more than one person's or entity's Disputes into a single case and cannot preside over any consolidated class or representative proceeding. Each party agrees the arbitrator's decision or award in one person's or entity's case can only impact the person or entity that brought a Dispute and cannot impact or otherwise be used to decide Disputes with other people or entities, including other AwareNet customers. If a court decides that this Section 13.10 is not enforceable or valid, then this Section 13.10 will be null and void without effect the rest of these Terms, and the rest of the Terms will still apply.</p>
                
                <h3>13.11 Compliance with Laws.</h3>
                <p>AwareNet shall comply with applicable laws, and at Customer's written request, AwareNet shall, within a reasonable period of time, execute a statement that it complies with such applicable laws.</p>
                
                <h3>13.12 Records.</h3>
                <p>The Parties acknowledge that AwareNet aspires to record data only from cameras recording public places where there is no expectation of privacy. AwareNet agrees to keep copies of the footage from the cameras and Customer Data for at least fifteen (15) days and take reasonable actions to make such footage and Customer Data available to Customer in the event Customer requires the same and requests such footage in writing. At any time, AwareNet, at its sole discretion and with or without notice to you, may remove a camera from the Services. Within a reasonable period after AwareNet receives Customer's written request to deactivate a camera from the Services, AwareNet shall deactivate such camera from the Services; provided, however, that such camera shall be in Customer's service area.</p>
                
                <h3>13.13 Miscellaneous.</h3>
                <p>These Terms and any Order Form are not intended to and shall not create any rights enforceable by any third party. These Terms may be executed in one or more counterparts each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. No change in these Terms shall be made except in writing executed by both parties.</p>
                
                <h3>13.14 Entire Agreement.</h3>
                <p>Except as provided in these Terms and any exhibits or attachments, applicable Order Form(s), or other terms incorporated by reference into these Terms, these Terms supersede all prior and contemporaneous proposals, statements, sales materials, presentations, or agreements, oral and written. The parties agree that, without limitation, Section 7.3 (Confidentiality) hereby supersedes and prevails over all prior, contemporaneous, and future non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements between the parties in their entirety. No oral or written information or advice given by us, our agents, or our employees will create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of the warranties or obligations under these Terms. Any term or condition stated in your vendor registration form or registration portal or in any purchase order document or similar document provided by you will be construed solely as evidence of your internal business processes, and the terms and conditions contained thereon will be null and void and have no effect with regard to these Terms between the parties and be non-binding against us even if accepted or signed by us after the Effective Date.</p>
                
                <p><strong>BY CLICKING THROUGH THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE AGREEING BY USE OF THE SERVICES, YOU HEREBY AGREE THAT YOU HAVE REVIEWED, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THESE TERMS, AND TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, FURTHER AGREE TO ENSURE THAT EACH OF YOUR EMPLOYEES AND OTHER END USERS DO THE SAME.</strong></p>
