                <h3>a. Community Guidelines.</h3>

We reserve the right to proactively moderate Content, although we expressly disclaim any obligation to do so, and we can remove Content, suspend, delete, limit, or deactivate your access to Services, or otherwise refuse service to you, if you violate these Terms, or our other policies, or if you infringe intellectual property, or otherwise engage in behavior that we think may harm AwareNet or an AwareNet neighborhood.</p>

                <h3>c. Disputes Between Members; Waiver of Claims Against AwareNet.</h3>
                <p>In the real world and online, neighbors sometimes disagree. If you have a dispute with another Member, we hope that you will be able to work it out amicably. However, if you can't, please understand that AwareNet is not responsible for the actions of our Members. Each of our Members is solely responsible for their own actions and behavior, whether they are using AwareNet or chatting with a neighbor over the back fence. Accordingly, you agree that AwareNet has no responsibility for the conduct of Members or other third parties and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you hereby release the AwareNet Entities (defined below) from losses, liabilities, claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with disputes involving you and other Members. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or releasing party."</p>

                <h2>6. MEMBER TRANSACTIONS</h2>
                
                <h3>a. Engaging Other Members.</h3>
                <p>AwareNet does not interview, run background checks on, monitor, supervise, direct or control Members. Use of the Services does not make us an employer, placement agency, representative, or agent of or for you or any other Member or service provider, and you acknowledge and agree that no such relationship is intended or created by these Terms or your use of the Services. If you and another Member decide to work together, the two of you, and not AwareNet, are solely responsible for complying with any applicable laws, such as tax and employment laws. Members are not independent contractors, employees, joint venturers, franchisees, or service providers to or for AwareNet.</p>
                
                <h3>b. Prohibited Transactions.</h3>
                <p>You may not use the Services to solicit, advertise for, or contact in any form, Members for any purpose not related to the Services. You may not use the Services to collect the contact information or other personal information of Members, by electronic means or otherwise, without our prior written consent.</p>
                
                <h3>c. AwareNet Only Provides a Venue.</h3>
                <p>AwareNet is not a party to interactions, transactions or disputes between Members, and while we may, in our discretion, help facilitate the resolution of disputes we have no control over and do not guarantee the integrity, responsibility, or actions of any Members. When interacting with other Members you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don't know. <strong>NEITHER AWARENET NOR OUR AFFILIATES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES. AWARENET AND OUR AFFILIATES WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.</strong></p>

                <h2>7. NOTIFICATION.</h2>
                
                <h3>a. Notifications.</h3>
                <p>By default, you will receive notifications from AwareNet related to your use of and interactions with the Services within the Services, to the email address to which your Enrollment is linked, and on your device or browser. You may also opt in to other kinds of notifications.</p>
                
                <h3>b. Text Messages.</h3>
                <p>AwareNet provides a text message service that provides Members with notifications relevant to their neighborhood, Enrollment, or other Services, such as urgent alerts. AwareNet does not charge for our text notifications, but your carrier may charge you for such messages. Text notifications may not be delivered if your phone is not in range of a transmission site, or if sufficient network capacity is not available at a particular time. Further, factors beyond the control of the user's wireless carrier or wireless internet provider may interfere with message delivery, including equipment, terrain, proximity to buildings, foliage, and weather. You acknowledge that notifications may not be timely received and that neither AwareNet nor your wireless carrier guarantees that text notifications will be delivered. These notifications are not intended to replace any primary phone service, such as a traditional landline or mobile phone that may be used to contact emergency services. You acknowledge and agree that AwareNet is not liable, and you shall not seek to hold AwareNet liable, for any damages related to your use of the text notification service.</p>

                <h2>9. THIRD-PARTY SITES AND SERVICES.</h2>

We don't endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party websites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access any third-party website, advertisement, service, or other Content from AwareNet, you do so at your own risk. AwareNet may not warn you that you are leaving the Services and are subject to the terms and conditions of another website or domain, which is not under the control of AwareNet. You agree that AwareNet has no liability arising from your use of or access to any third-party website, service, or Content.</p>

                <p>We may offer additional Services and product features, or add, change, or discontinue our existing Services and product features at any time and in any region, with or without notice to you. If you are dissatisfied, your sole remedy is to stop using our Services or the affected feature.</p>

                <h2>11. RESTRICTIONS FROM OUR LICENSORS.</h2>
                <p>Some of the information and Services available through AwareNet are licensed from or supported by third parties. These third-party terms and disclosures apply to your use of the Services.</p>

                <h2>12. INDEMNIFICATION.</h2>
                <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold AwareNet and our affiliates, related companies, officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, partners, and licensors (the "AwareNet Entities") harmless from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation reasonable attorney's fees and costs, made by any third party due to or arising out of any and all of the following (a) your use of the Services; (b) your violation of these Terms; (c) your violation of applicable laws or regulations; (d) your violation of any rights of another party, including any Members; (e) your interactions and transactions with other Members; or (f) your Member Content. We reserve the right to control the defense of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims and to not settle any claim without our prior written consent. You agree that the provisions of this section will survive any termination of your Enrollment(s), the Terms, and/or your access to the Services.</p>

                <h2>13. DISCLAIMERS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
                
                <h3>a. Disclaimers; No Warranties.</h3>

                <h2>16. JURISDICTION-SPECIFIC PROVISIONS.</h2>
                
                <h3>a. United States.</h3>
                <p>If you live in the United States, this section applies to you.</p>
                
                <p><strong>i. Governing law, Jurisdiction and Venue.</strong> These Terms are governed by Missouri law, without giving effect to any conflict of law principles, except as may be otherwise provided in the Arbitration Agreement section of these Terms. However, the governing law provision regarding the interpretation of these Terms is not intended to create any other substantive right to non-Missourians to assert claims under Missouri law whether that be by statute, common law, or otherwise. This section is only intended to specify the use of Missouri law to interpret these Terms. Both you and AwareNet agree that all claims and disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms (and any Supplemental Terms unless expressly otherwise set forth in such Supplemental Terms) that are not subject to arbitration per these Terms will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri or a state court located in St. Louis City, and you hereby submit to the exclusive jurisdiction thereof.</p>
                
                <p><strong>ii. Arbitration Agreement.</strong> You and AwareNet agree to the arbitration and dispute resolution terms in this section (the "Arbitration Agreement"). For the purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, references to "AwareNet," "you," "we" and "us" include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, employers, partners, predecessors in interest, successors, assigns, and heirs. We encourage you to carefully read these important terms, which include a requirement that claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (and any Supplemental Terms unless expressly otherwise set forth in such Supplemental Terms) shall be brought individually and subject to arbitration, subject to the exceptions in Section 16(a)(iii), Section 16(a)(iv), and Section 16(a)(v), and include instructions for how to opt out if you do not agree.</p>
                
                <p><strong>iii. Small Claims Court.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or AwareNet may bring an individual action in small claims court.</p>
                
                <p><strong>iv. Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or AwareNet may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
                
                <p><strong>v. Claims not Subject to Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
                
                <p><strong>vi. Applicability.</strong> You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, or to any aspect of your relationship with AwareNet, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert certain qualifying claims in small claims court in accordance with the terms above.</p>
                
                <p><strong>vii. Arbitration rules and forum.</strong> These Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce and that notwithstanding the provision above with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1 et seq. ("FAA") will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings. If for whatever reason the FAA is inapplicable, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to AwareNet, 6544 Neosho St, St Louis, MO 63109, attn: Legal Department, with copy to <a href="mailto:legal-arbitration@awarenet.us">legal-arbitration@awarenet.us</a>. Your letter must include (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) the party's portion of the applicable filing fee. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys' fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a>. All other claims shall be subject to JAMS's most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>. JAMS's rules are also available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you can't afford to pay JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing, and/or other fees and can't obtain a waiver from JAMS, AwareNet will pay them for you. In addition, AwareNet will reimburse all such JAMS's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims, such amounts totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you reside, or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                
                <p><strong>viii. Authority of arbitrator.</strong> The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (i) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (ii) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The exceptions to the preceding sentence are (1) all disputes arising out of or relating to the class action waiver, including any claim that all or part of the class action waiver is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or such class action waiver has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) all disputes arising out of or relating to the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (3) all disputes arising out of or relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and AwareNet. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum's rules, and the Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                
                <p><strong>ix. Waiver of jury trial.</strong> YOU AND AWARENET HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provision remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.</p>
                
                <p><strong>x. Waiver of class or other non-individualized relief.</strong> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER can't BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection's limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the federal or state court located in St. Louis, Missouri. All other claims shall be arbitrated.</p>
                
                <p><strong>xi. 30-day right to opt out.</strong> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of these Terms that mandate arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: <a href="mailto:legal-arbitration@awarenet.us">legal-arbitration@awarenet.us</a>, within 30 days after first becoming subject to a version of these Terms containing an arbitration provision. Your notice must include your name and address, your AwareNet username (if any), the email address you used to enroll (if you enrolled), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of arbitration, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of arbitration has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter into in the future, with us.</p>
                
                <p><strong>xii. Severability.</strong> Except as provided in Section 16(a)(x) (Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
                
                <p><strong>xiii. Survival of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with AwareNet.</p>
                
                <p><strong>xiv. Material Changes.</strong> Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if AwareNet makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing AwareNet at the following address: <a href="mailto:legal-arbitration@awarenet.us">legal-arbitration@awarenet.us</a>.</p>
